# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

## Description

- I was motivated to create a guide to outline my notes on the bootcamp in one location to reference through the course work.
- I built this project because it is difficult to take notes in a comprehensive and condensed fashion in an application.
- It solves the problem many bootcamp students have of recording important information to reference when things become condensed and overwhelming.
- I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Github, and JavaScript to create a website with functionality to solve a problem and meet criteria set by a client.
